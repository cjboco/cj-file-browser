Create Your Own Handler Engine for CJ File Browser

One of the main features of CJ File Browser is the capability to use various
server technologies besides ColdFusion, to handle all the server calls. In order
to do this, you may need to create your own plug-in for the new Handler Engine
System. This guide will provide you with the layout, required functions and
function responses that are needed in order to do this.

Unfortunately, in order for you to create your own Handler Engine plug-in, you
are going to need at least some basic knowledge of programming language. There's
just to much going on on the functions to effectively explain it all here. You
are going to need to be able to open up one of the existing handler engine
plug-ins to get a grasp of what it's doing. If any of this is not making sense,
then don't hesitate to ask a question. I'm more than happy to provide any
insight into making these!

The Handler Engine System

The handler engine is just a collection of functions that
handle various aspects of CJ File Browser. It handles things like, reading a
directory, uploading a file and grabbing image file thumbnails from the server.
For ColdFusion, these functions are located in a ColdFusion Component File
(CFC). CJ File Browser uses jQuery to make calls to this file using AJAX. The
handler returns it's results as a JSON object, which is used to handle the
various user actions.
