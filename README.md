My Hit List
=======================
* Fixed a long standing issue, whereas if you activate the browser while having an image selected in tinyMCE, the browser window would be pointing to the index file or webroot file.

* Cookies, cookies cookies.

* Drag and drop file upload should be fully functional.

* Added a drag bar to allow you to resize the sidebar/browser.

Known Issues
=======================
* Cookies. I'm storing the last directory accessed in a cookie. I was running into a lot of problem with this with "multiple" cjFileBrowser's and have different base paths. I think I nipped it (finally), but still not 100%. Let me know of issues.

* I've started implementing "drag & drop" to allow you to move files and directories. The drag and drop is set up, but it's not doing anything at this point.

* I've started adding the frame work classes to make this jQuery UI Themable. Haven't had a lot of time to think this through yet, but you might see some weird stuff as I play around.
